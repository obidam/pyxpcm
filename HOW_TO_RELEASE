How to issue a pyxpcm release

 1. Ensure your master branch is synced to upstream:
       git pull upstream master
 2. Look over whats-new.rst and the docs. Make sure "What's New" is complete
    (check the date!) and consider adding a brief summary note describing the
    release at the top.
    Things to watch out for:
    - Important new features should be highlighted towards the top.
    - Function/method references should include links to the API docs.
    - Sometimes notes get added in the wrong section of whats-new, typically
      due to a bad merge. Check for these before a release by using git diff,
      e.g., ``git diff v0.X.Y whats-new.rst`` where 0.X.Y is the previous
      release.
    - You can compare the master branch with the last release tag, eg: https://github.com/obidam/pyxpcm/compare/v0.4.0...master
 3. If you have any doubts, run the full test suite one final time!
      py.test
 4. On the master branch, commit the release in git:
      git commit -a -m 'Release v0.X.Y'
 5. Tag the release:
      git tag -a v0.X.Y -m 'v0.X.Y'
 6. Build source and binary wheels for pypi:
      git clean -xdf  # this deletes all uncommited changes!
      python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist
 7. Use twine to register and upload the release on pypi. Be careful, you can't
    take this back!
      twine upload dist/pyxpcm-0.X.Y*
    You will need to be listed as a package owner at
    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyxpcm for this to work.
 8. Push your changes to master:
      git push upstream master
      git push upstream --tags
10. Add a section for the next release (v.X.(Y+1)) to docs/whats-new.rst.
11. Commit your changes and push to master again:
      git commit -a -m 'Revert to dev version'
      git push upstream master
    You're done pushing to master!
12. Issue the release on GitHub. Click on "Draft a new release" at
    https://github.com/obidam/pyxpcm/releases. Type in the version number, but
    don't bother to describe it -- we maintain that on the docs instead.
13. Update the docs. Login to https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyxpcm/versions/
    and switch your new release tag (at the bottom) from "Inactive" to "Active".
    It should now build automatically.
